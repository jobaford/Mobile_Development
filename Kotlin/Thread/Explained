### What is a thread?

* A **thread** = a path of execution inside a program.
* Every program has a **main thread** that runs code line by line.

---

### Why more threads?

* If one task is slow (like loading data), it **blocks the main thread**.
* Adding another thread lets that work run in the background while the main thread keeps going.

---

### Example

```kotlin
Thread.sleep(5000) // main thread waits 5 sec
```

Blocks everything.

```kotlin
Thread {
    Thread.sleep(5000)
    println("Thread 2 finished")
}.start()
```

Runs in **another thread**, so main thread isnâ€™t blocked.

---

ðŸ‘‰ **Analogy**:

* Main thread = one road.
* If one car stops, all cars stop.
* Extra thread = a second road so traffic keeps moving.
