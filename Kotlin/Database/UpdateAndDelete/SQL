### ✏️ Update Data

Use `UPDATE` to change a value:

```sql
UPDATE books
SET author = "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"
WHERE id = 1;
```

* `SET` → what to change
* `WHERE` → which row (important!)
  Without `WHERE`, **all rows** update.

---

### 🗑️ Delete Data

Use `DELETE` to remove a row:

```sql
DELETE FROM books
WHERE id = 2;
```

Without `WHERE`, **everything** gets deleted.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* `UPDATE` → change data
* `DELETE` → remove data
* Always use `WHERE` to target one row
