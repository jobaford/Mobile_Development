### 🔍 Filtering and Sorting Data

**Goal:** Find exercises based on calories and time.

---

### 🧠 Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs
WHERE calories > 50
ORDER BY calories ASC;
```

➡ Shows exercises burning more than 50 calories (smallest to largest).

---

### 🧩 Combine Conditions

```sql
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs
WHERE calories > 50 AND minutes < 30
ORDER BY calories ASC;
```

➡ Shows exercises that burn **over 50 calories** **and** take **less than 30 minutes**.

---

✅ **Keywords:**

* `ORDER BY` → sorts results
* `AND` → combines multiple conditions
