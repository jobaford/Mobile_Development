### ðŸ”— What a JOIN Does

A **JOIN** combines data from **two or more tables** using a shared column â€” usually an **ID**.

---

### ðŸ§± Example

We have two tables:

* `books` â†’ stores book info
* `reviews` â†’ stores reviews linked by `book_id`

To connect them:

```sql
SELECT books.title, reviews.review, reviews.name
FROM books
JOIN reviews
ON books.id = reviews.book_id;
```

---

âœ… **Result:**
Shows each bookâ€™s title, the review text, and the reviewerâ€™s name â€” all in one table.
