### Packages

* A **package** = a folder to organize related code (classes, interfaces, etc.).
* Example:

  * `com.example.classes` â†’ holds all your classes.
  * `com.example.main` â†’ holds your main function.

ðŸ‘‰ This keeps code organized and easy to find.

---

### Imports

* To **use code from another package**, you must import it.

```kotlin
import com.example.classes.Team   // import one class
import com.example.classes.*      // import everything from the package
```

---

âœ… **Memory tip**:

* **Package** = drawer where code lives.
* **Import** = pulling items from that drawer so you can use them.
