### ⚙️ What Are Coroutines?

Coroutines let your app **do long tasks (like downloads or database work)** without freezing the screen.

### 🧠 How It Works

* Apps run on the **main thread** (handles quick tasks like UI updates).
* **Heavy tasks** can block it and make the app freeze.
* **Threads** can help, but too many threads use too much memory.
* **Coroutines** fix this by letting **many tasks share one thread** efficiently.

✅ **In short:**
Coroutines are lightweight, efficient background workers that run long tasks **without blocking** the main thread.
