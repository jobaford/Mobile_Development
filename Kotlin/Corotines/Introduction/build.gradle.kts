`implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")`

This line is used in a **Gradle build file** (which is a tool that helps manage and build Kotlin or Java projects).

Here’s what each part means:

* **`implementation(...)`** → tells Gradle that your project **needs this library** to work. It will automatically download it from the internet and include it in your app.

* **`"org.jetbrains.kotlinx"`** → this is the **group** or **organization** that made the library — in this case, JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin).

* **`"kotlinx-coroutines-core"`** → this is the **name of the library** you’re adding. It provides tools to run tasks **asynchronously** (for example, doing background work without freezing your app).

* **`"1.6.4"`** → this is the **version number** of the library you’re using.

💡 **In simple words:**
This line tells your project:

> “Download and use the Kotlin Coroutines library (version 1.6.4) made by JetBrains, so I can easily run tasks in the background.”

Would you like me to explain what **coroutines** are in simple terms too?
