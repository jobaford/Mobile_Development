Inheritance in Kotlin = **reusing code from one class in another**.
You make a *base (parent) class* with common properties & functions, then *child classes* extend it to avoid duplicate code.
You can also **override** base functions to give child classes their own behavior.

**Example:**

```kotlin
open class Vehicle(val name: String, val color: String) {
    open fun move() = println("$name is moving")
    fun stop() = println("$name has stopped")
}

class Car(name: String, color: String, val engines: Int, val doors: Int) :
    Vehicle(name, color)

class Plane(name: String, color: String, val engines: Int, val doors: Int) :
    Vehicle(name, color) {
    override fun move() {
        println("The plane is flying")
        super.move()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val car = Car("BMW", "Red", 1, 4)
    val plane = Plane("Boeing", "White", 4, 4)

    car.move()
    car.stop()

    plane.move()
    plane.stop()
}
```

**Output:**

```
BMW is moving
BMW has stopped
The plane is flying
Boeing is moving
Boeing has stopped
```
