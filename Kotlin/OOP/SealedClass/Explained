Here’s a **super short and simple explanation** of your text:

**Sealed Classes vs Enums in Kotlin (Simple Version):**

* **Enums** are good for a fixed set of values (like `Success` or `Error`).

* **Problem:** Enums cannot hold extra info (like an exception message).

* **Sealed Classes** solve this:

  * You define a `sealed class Result`.
  * You can have subclasses (`Success`, `Error`, `Progress`) with extra properties.
  * Compiler knows all possible subclasses → `when` statements must cover all cases (exhaustive).
  * IDE can auto-generate all branches for you.
  * You can have nested subclasses (like `RecoverableError` and `NonRecoverableError`) with their own properties.

**Key Benefits:**

1. Can store extra data in subclasses.
2. Compiler helps ensure all cases are handled.
3. More flexible and powerful than enums.

**Example Use:**

```kotlin
sealed class Result(val message: String)

class Success(message: String) : Result(message)
class Error(message: String) : Result(message)
class Progress(message: String) : Result(message)

fun getData(result: Result) {
    when(result) {
        is Success -> println(result.message)
        is Error -> println(result.message)
        is Progress -> println(result.message)
    }
}
```

✅ Now `when` is exhaustive, and each type can carry extra info.
