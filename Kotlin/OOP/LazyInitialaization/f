Lazy initialization = Create an object only when you first use it, not when you declare it.
Useful if object creation is slow or uses a lot of memory.

Example:

```kotlin
val user2 by lazy { User("First", "Last", 0) }
```

* Object isnâ€™t created until you access `user2` in code.
* Saves resources if it might never be used.
