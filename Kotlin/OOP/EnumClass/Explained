**Enum classes** = special classes for a **fixed set of constant values** that can also have **properties** and **functions**.

**Example:**

```kotlin
enum class Direction(val distance: Int) {
    NORTH(10), SOUTH(20), EAST(50), WEST(40);

    fun printData() {
        println("Direction: $name, Distance: $distance")
    }
}
```

* Use with `when`:

```kotlin
val dir = Direction.EAST
when (dir) {
    Direction.EAST -> println("Go East")
    Direction.WEST -> println("Go West")
    Direction.NORTH -> println("Go North")
    Direction.SOUTH -> println("Go South")
}
```

* You can loop with `Direction.values()` and get from string with `Direction.valueOf("EAST")`.
